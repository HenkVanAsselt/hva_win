This project was written around 1991 till 2001 to create a Turbo-C like GUI.
I found it back, stored on a 3.5" floppy disk.
I highly doubt that this sourcecode will ever be re-used again, but by placing it on GitHub, it will not get lost.

Bare in mind that in this time, a 386 processor running with 133 MHz was considered extremely fast, and 
the main OS was DOS 5 or DOS 6.2.   Also the internet as we know it today did not exist, and we had to
rely on 9600 bps modems and connected to a BBS (Bulletin Board System).

Anyway, this software provided a text based GUI, like Turbo-C with a menu-bar, drop down menus, checklists, 
possibilities to enter parameters and it was very fast.

A trick which was used here was to build the GUI elements in a memory block, and then copy part of the GUI
to the memory block which was used by the VGA adapter.

It was even possible to use 2 monitors. The first screen had VGA resolution, and when a Hercules video
adapter card was used, then a 2nd monitor could be used for debugging output.

Have fun,
Henk
